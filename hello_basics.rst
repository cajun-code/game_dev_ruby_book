Methods
---------

Some things, such as the class statement, I will explain later just believe me when I say they are necessary. What I want to 
focus on first is the def statement.  Def is used to defind a method.  This method can have paramaters as in::

  def say_greet(name)
  
this method has one paramater called name.  Information is passed into the method though this point.  Every code segment in ruby 
ends with the word "end".  The statements inside a code segment (from def to end) are called blocks of code.
